Configuration after installation 
================================
This section will provide information on how the user can configure the software after it has been installed. 

Environment Variables
---------------------

-   Make sure you add Python to your system PATH enviroment variable. To manually add Python to your enviroment variables please look at this guide: `Add Pthon To Enviroment Variables <https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-add-python-to-path-variable-in-windows>`_.


File Paths
----------

-   The projects file paths have already been configured and there is no need for the user to modify the paths


Customize User Interface
------------------------

-   Unfortunatly the application does not provide customizability of the UI (i.e. layouts, colours, and control and navigations schemes).
