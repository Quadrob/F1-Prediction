Troubleshooting 
===============
This section is one of the most important ones to include which requires concise documentation for the end-user and potential software administrators. During the testing phase, you will likely have encountered bugs or issues that may affect certain systems or hardware configurations. Since you cannot account for full fixes for all types of systems or hardware configurations, the troubleshooting documentation can be used to provide guidelines on dealing with common issues that can be fixed by the user themselves. Such information can include; o Providing clear error messages ▪ This can help user self-diagnose issues
o Providing a method of logging or generating a log file ▪ This can help users submit error logs to help software provider or community members help understand and fix common issues
o Providing answers to common errors using a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) ▪ Keep track of commonly occurring errors you faced in your software development and implementation processes
▪ Address common installation issues and solutions (i.e. being unable to install or modify software due to permissions or privileges)
o Provide users a way to contact support
o Include additional documentation, videos and links to additional third party resources or communities where relevant troubleshooting help can be found.
