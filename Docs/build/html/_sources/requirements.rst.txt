============
Problem Statement
-----------------
With the growing competitiveness in the world of motorsports, and hundreds of teams battling for the crown of the fastest on the grid, it becomes difficult for team managers to analyse their competitors, drivers, as well as their performance. The F1 Predict Application assists teams with this by predicting their chances at the championship, analysing how they are affected by external factors, predicting all team results, and suggesting the best drivers for their cars.

Prior Knowledge Requirements
----------------------------
*   Knowledge of databases that will store the data used for analysis
*   Intermediate to advanced knowledge of a the Python programming language
*   Beginner knowledge of user interface development
*   Knowledge of Formula 1 and the information needed for prediction

Project Requirements
--------------------
*   Create an application that can predict the results of future races taking into account all the factors that influence the outcome
*   To determine future results, the application will leverage machine learning to process, understand, and use the data about drivers, teams, and external factors
*   Integrate a database that the application can use to store and retrieve this data
*   Create a user interface which is user-friendly and attractive and allows the user to navigate as well as view results

Project Goals
-------------
*   The application should predict the future results of races for each team
*   The application should take into consideration the impact of a driver's performance metrics on race outcomes
*   The application should take into consideration the impact of a team\’s performance metrics on race outcomes
*   The application should take into consideration the impact of external factors such as weather, race track, and travel on race outcomes
*   The application should suggest the optimum driver for a team\’s car  The application should predict the chances of a team winning the Formula 1 championship
*   The application should display the predictions in an easy-to-understand format and allow users to view the different information it has to offer
